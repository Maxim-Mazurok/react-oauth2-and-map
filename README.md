# ToDo:

- [x] Configure webpack with babel and plugins
- [x] Add and configure TypeScript, SCSS
- [x] Add linting and code style solutions, such as eslint/gts
- [x] Set up Jest and react-testing-library for running tests
- [x] Probably, use Bootstrap CSS framework (as on the myNewMotion)
- [x] Get rif of the Bootstrap because it's an overhead for such a simple layout, but leave it as a branch for historical purpose
- [x] Probably, no routing will be required (as seen on the myNewMotion, login and map are on the same page)
- [ ] Login form component
  - [x] Basic markup
  - [x] Media queries
  - [x] Add loading indicator, disable fields
  - [x] Replace react-media with MediaQueryListListener
  - [ ] (future) Email/password validation/errors
  - [ ] (future) Save token
  - [ ] (future) Hide form on mobile with tiny VH
  - [ ] (future) Debounce form loading
  - [ ] Unit tests
    - [x] Desktop
    - [x] Mobile
    - [ ] (!!!) Generic
- [ ] Map component
  - [x] Basic markup
  - [x] Probably, DIY
  - [x] Maybe mark "Adresgegevens nog niet verwerkt" as greyed out
  - [x] Markers for retina
  - [ ] (future) Add "locate me" button
  - [ ] (low priority) - partially solved by loading simultaneously. Maybe load map only after getting charging points to eliminate default map flash
  - [ ] (!!!) Unit tests
- [ ] User info component
  - [x] Basic markup
  - [ ] (!!!) Unit tests
- [ ] Oauth2 service
  - [x] Basic implementation

- [ ] Cross-browser testing
  - [ ] (future) Determine which polyfills are actually required (reduce bundle size)
  - [ ] (!!!) Basic testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing
  - [ ] (future) Think about the contrast of labels and button...

# Getting Started

## Setup Environment

### Install specific node and npm versions (recommended, but optional step)

1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) depending on your OS.
   ```shell script
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
   ```
1. Install node version from `.nvmrc` file (recommended optional step):
   ```shell script
   nvm install
   ```
1. Install npm version from `package.json` -> `engines.npm`:

   ```shell script
   npm i -g npm@$(grep '"npm"' package.json | cut -d '"' -f 4)
   ```

## Build and Run

1. Install dependencies (both prod and dev are required for build, overwrite NODE_ENV from env variables if it's `production`):
   ```shell script
   NODE_ENV=development npm install
   ```
1. Build (for production):
   ```shell script
   npm run build
   ```
   or Run development server with live-reload:
   ```shell script
   npm start
   ```
